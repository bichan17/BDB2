Forget-me-not is an upcoming experiment about productivity and plants. A plant recieves water based on how much work is done in a to-do list. If enough work is done, it will be fed. If not, the plant will go unfed. I will commit to working this way for a yet to be determined amount of time and track both my progress and the plant's progress on this website.

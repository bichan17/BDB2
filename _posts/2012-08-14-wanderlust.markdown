Wanderlust was an interactive installation piece designed to invoke exploration and discovery through interaction with physical objects. In an all encompassing audio-visual environment, users were able to travel to a completely different part of the world and live vicariously through our exhibit. The user assumed the role of a hiker climbing up a mountain, and by using three different interfaces (a hiking stick, climbing sliders, and mounted binoculars), the user was able to interact with the environment.

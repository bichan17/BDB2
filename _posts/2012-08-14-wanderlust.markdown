Wanderlust is an immersive experience designed to encourage travel through interaction with physical objects. In an all encompassing audio-visual environment, users will be able to travel to a completely different part of the world and live vicariously through our exhibit. The user will walk into a dark, enclosed projection screen setup with 4 installation kiosks to interact with. The user progresses through a vacation travel experience by interacting with each of the tangible items reminiscent to something in the environment.

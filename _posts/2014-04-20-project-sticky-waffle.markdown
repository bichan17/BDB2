Sticky Waffle is a music synthesizer and visualizer that was built using the Web Audio API, the HTML Canvas, and object oriented JavaScript. This project is a product of a collaboration between Luis Rosario and I. Using a modular design pattern, we divided the work so that I wrote the synthesizer half while Luis wrote the visualizer half, and together we worked to unite the two.
